# TODO list

- PORT TO OTHER GAMES! Tag Force Special is first on the line!

- Create a randomizer based on the username (kinda like GT4 randomizer)

- Reduce memory requirements by splitting sections into individual modules - currently it's a monolithic build which breaks the field module in TF6

- Maybe pause the game while the menu is open?

- sound test menu

- improve the config parser to use something human readable instead

- enable debug menu on older TF games

- fix multi-line jank on dialog boxes - newline stuff isn't being properly calculated

- make more tools to help translators - duel cutin subtitle tester from the debug menu would be very useful!

- disable partner favorite cards cheat
